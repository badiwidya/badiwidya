ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm @badiwidya!
ðŸŒŸ Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I'm really interested in Backend Development, currently on a journey to master the art of creating efficient, scalable, and robust systems. While I'm still learning, Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how the backend works and enjoy exploring technologies that power modern applications.

ðŸŽ¯ At the moment, Iâ€™m learning databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, sharpening my skills with backend frameworks such as Express.js, and even trying my hand at frontend development with React.js to broaden my knowledge.

ðŸš€ I love challenging myself with new problems and exploring exciting technologies that can make a real-world impact. Though Iâ€™m still in the learning phase, Iâ€™m eager to grow, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful projects.
